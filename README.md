Integrative Data Analysis of single-cell multi-omics data using Autoencoder Neural Network

Concatenating RNA and Protein Data with pandas – Building a custom Autoencoder with PyTorch for Clustering – Training the data on the model – Dimension reduction on the data with the encoder to 20 dimensions and then with UMAP to 2 dimensions for visualization – Visualization of the data with Plotly to demonstrate cell clustering and characterization
